# TinyLAB: TinyLDOP
TinyLAB is a project that was created from the idea of enabling hobbyists and engineers to have the necessary electronic equipment for their projects without the need of buying expensive and bulky equipment.

TinyLDOP is the first part of this project and its purpose is to generate additional (low current) voltage rails from a single power supply.

It designed to be placed at the middle part of a breadboard as shown:

# Specifications
Other specifications such as load regulation and noise can not be determined as I do not have the necessary equipment right now.

| Specification       | Value                      |
|---------------|----------------------------------|
| Input voltage range (limited by input capacitor voltage rating) [V]  | 3.75â€“24 |
| Maximum output current [mA]         | 500  |

I am currently analysing the current capability as a function of the dissipated power, to use the board within safe operating temperatures.
